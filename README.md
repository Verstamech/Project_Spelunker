# Project_Spelunker
Temporary name for a game I'm making in my college Game Development class. The current plan: A metroidvania genre game, inspired by Hollow Knight and Subnautica. Dive into an ocean, making your way through the decaying depths. Don't dive too far unprepared, though, as the denizens of the deep get as unwelcoming as the ocean's crushing water pressure.
